261,Adorable and flattering,This top is very cute. got it in the lighter color. the fit is great and it will go with many things. if size medium were not out of stock in the blue color i would have purchased that one also.,General,Tops,Blouses,50
6466,Casual and dressy,I love the color of this top. it is a dark olive green and elegant. i mostly wear it under a blazer with my jeans. it fits true to size and the smocking detail is casual and elegant at the same time.,General Petite,Tops,Knits,44
9853,,"I like the color and design. it looked super cute when i tried it on, but when i brought it home, i washed it in the washing mashine and hung it to dry and it shrank before i even got to wear it. be careful with washing it!",General Petite,Dresses,Dresses,32
20688,A little boxy,"I love this tunic, the detail the weight, the fringe. but it runs big. i would have done better to have ordered one size smaller. i think it would have looked more tailored if i had gotten the medium.",General Petite,Tops,Sweaters,54
10497,Not a good fit,"I ordered this dress online. the colors are pretty (if you like pastels) and the fit is true to size, however, it fits very much like a maternity dress. for those of you rocking a baby bump, this is a good choice. for others who are not, it's just not flattering. my figure got lost in the dress and the high waist did not look good on me. i returned it.",General Petite,Dresses,Dresses,34
17662,,"Runs extremely large. i got an xs and am 5'4"" 115lbs and this would have fit someone who typically wears a size 10-14 and is 5'6"" and above. very disappointed with the size. the quality of the fabric wasn't great either. i wanted it to work so bad but just didn't!",General Petite,Jackets,Jackets,35
2634,Super cute,"I feel slim and comfortable in these cute trousers.  got compliments at work.   they are definitely more of a work pant, due to the material.  i think i could wear them outside of work (look-wise), but maybe wouldn't feel as comfortable in them after the hours of nine-to-five, due to the material.",General,Bottoms,Pants,41
12546,Swingy and flirty,"Very nice soft fabric, has a nice swingy drape and flair. i use it to work out in , sleep in and just hang out around the house. could be paired with white pink or black leggings and a scarf too. very happy with this purchase.",General Petite,Tops,Knits,41
7089,Yep!,"Pretty much awesome... i tried it on in regualr size jsut to see, and i could almost get away with it... too bad i dind't try it on before hte 25% of f dresses... (also, i don't have an occasion to wear this).

length is midi, but since it is gathered, i could pull it up a little so it falls in the right spot on me.

color is very nice, overall sexy dress.

material is soft and comfortable, nothing wrong except i missed out on the sale! :-)",General Petite,Dresses,Dresses,39

13952,Pills horribly,"I splurged on this pajama set for myself and now regret it. even though the design is adorable, the knitted fabric contains acrylic and started pilling a lot within the first week of wear. after a month and a couple washes, it looks horrible. it may be the worst case of pilling i've ever seen in a fabric. so so disappointed. it initially fit true to size but has stretched out a bit over time.",General Petite,Intimate,Lounge,30
7844,Eye-catching and unique,"These shorts are very well made and the embroidery work is beautiful. the dark yellow is a little bit more orangy looking than in the pictures, but is still a pretty color. don't expect any give or stretch with these shorts.",General,Bottoms,Shorts,19
22881,Perfect fall sweater!,"I love drop shoulder sweaters and find them to be very flattering so i took a chance on this one despite the reviews stating it runs very large. i was attracted to the style as well as the natural cotton fiber, which i find holds up best over time. i am 34b and usually wear xs or small and in this i ordered the xs. it fits perfectly! i layered this soft pink sweater over a rounded hem tee with a black and white pattern; so cute! it is slightly short on my 5'8"" frame so the shirt tail hems peeked",General,Tops,Sweaters,38

17497,This is green and runs large,Just tried this on in store. the color in the photo is wayyyyy off. it's a hunter green and dark navy zigzag. for maeve it runs large. i am usually a medium or a 10 and a s worked best. i'm a 36d and there was no pull at the bust. will pick up when on sale (bc a hundo for rayon is laughable).,General Petite,Tops,Blouses,35
22993,Surprise!,"I love clothing that has little surprises, and i love the detailing at the arms with the lace-like openings which is not very characteristic (and actually quite fancy) for a typical henley. i found the fabric to be medium weight-and thought the quality was fine. i like all of the colors this comes in-each would fit into my wardrobe nicely. i have gotten into comfortable clothing (that is still flattering and functional) lately and am on a huge kick of gravitating toward it. this top certainly is",General Petite,Intimate,Lounge,35
6526,Cute and comfortable!,Just got this skirt in the mail and i am so happy i took a chance and ordered it! my waist is a lot smaller than my hips so skirts can be a challenge! but this one fit me perfectly! it is casual but i can also see myself wearing this to work in the summer months. it is super flattering and very comfortable! the fabric is soft and it does have some give. i am usually a size 30 in pilcro chinos and the size 10 in this skirt fit me perfectly. so i would say it runs true to size. a great addition to,General,Bottoms,Skirts,47

20432,Adorable but runs small,"I agree with others that this top runs small. i am usually a 2/4 in retailer tops and the small was very tight around the chest area. however, it looked so cute on! i wanted to buy it so badly, but it just didn't work for me. the design is absolutely adorable but i could not lift my arms without the whole top riding up. they did not have a medium in the store so i couldn't see if a larger size would work. overall, such a cute top, just not appropriate for someone my age or practical for someone ch",General,Tops,Blouses,38
22,Not what it looks like,"First of all, this is not pullover styling. there is a side zipper. i wouldn't have purchased it if i knew there was a side zipper because i have a large bust and side zippers are next to impossible for me.

second of all, the tulle feels and looks cheap and the slip has an awkward tight shape underneath.

not at all what is looks like or is described as. sadly will be returning, but i'm sure i will find something to exchange it for!",General,Dresses,Dresses,31
15825,,"Did want to love this jacket because i have so much black and white, but i saw it on my daughter and had to have it. i usually take a large, but i needed an extra large, and the fit is great. the material is not too heavy, so i know it can wear it year round by adjusting the weight of tee underneath.",General,Tops,Knits,69

83,Just lovely,"I purchased this top in an antro store last week. the quality is wonderful and the greenish blue color is very unique. the blouse has a beautiful stretchy camsiole that is attached at the shoulders, but can be removed by snaps. i tooks great when worn two different ways. i wore it with the campole out, and it peeks through the blouse at the bottom. it also looks great when the camisole is worn in. my only wish is that it would come in a petite size as it's a touch big at the shoulders and neckli",General,Tops,Blouses,68
11734,Even more lovely in person!,"I've been stalking this top online and finally went into the store today to see it.  i'm so glad i did!  the colors are very vibrant and the material is soft and very lightweight.  the cut covers a regular bra pretty well (a big plus!) and makes my arms look good!  i can't wait to wear this, it will be a perfect dressy top for the higher heat days!",General Petite,Tops,Blouses,44
21271,Versatile piece,"I haven't worn this yet, but i can't wait too! i'm 5'3 145 pounds, ordered a size small. it's fits perfect! in fact, it's long enough that i may be able to pull it off as a mini dress on a hot day. that said, i will mostly layer this piece. the ruching on the side flatters the body. i would buy this in more colors if it was available! also, the material is a nice soft quality.",General,Tops,Knits,43
4624,Wearable art,"I bought this recently after trying on both the small and xs. for reference, i'm small-framed, 5'3"", 120 pounds, size 4 in most clothes, but can't wear petite sizes, usually a small or medium in retailer tops. i liked the fit and length of the small but the armholes were so big you could see the whole side of my bra. no one wants to see anyone's bra, not even their bra straps. i'd worn a white cami in under my tee that day, so i put it on and it improved the side view, but i didn't like the white",General,Tops,Knits,67
13015,Love the fit,"I was fortunate to order the perfect size the first time. i am 5'3"" and 125 and ordered the size 4. it is a great fit. these lightweight pants are super cute and i especially love the way they are cut to dip a bit lower (not asymmetrical, just talking about the drape) on the inside hem so outside hem is perky and the bottom looks wide and is flattering. these zip up the back and the back lays flat which is also flattering. i love the look of the fabric so if i have a complaint it's that for the",General,Bottoms,Pants,67
18064,Size up!,"The only reason i gave 4 stars instead of 5 is that it is way too small in the chest if you have anything up there.i usually always wear size 4 dresses. not in this dress! this beauty is a full size too small. trust me it is gorgeous but there is no stretch. it needs a zipper . that said, i exchanged it for the size 6 and all the flaws that i've read in reviews disappear. the sleeves are better and it falls nicely and is comfortable. also, there is no lining. just good to know.once you get it ov",General Petite,Dresses,Dresses,53
8530,So great,"This is quite possibly the greatest jacket of all time. i ordered it with the ""layered luna dress"" in grey, and i am now giddy with excitement to wear the combo! very chic. i am confident this will be a staple in the years to come. for reference, i ordered my normal size xs (5'5, 115 lbs, muscular) and did not find it to be too tight in the arms (and i have fairly broad shoulders). i did not try it on with long sleeves, but i still think there would be adequate room.",General Petite,Jackets,Jackets,33

8207,Clings to the body,"I love the way this dress hangs straight down on the model, but on me it looked tacky.  i'm 5'6 and 130 lbs, and this dress hit me in all the wrong places.  i got a size small- sizing up would be huge in the top of the dress (and the arm holes are already dangerously large).  i wish this were just a little bit a-line.  instead, it's literally like someone just extended the length of a t-shirt.",General Petite,Dresses,Dresses,36
19792,Missed the mark!,"Very disappointed: runs small in chest and too long. the fabric is cheap but the print is pretty with the bead and flower detail. i don't think  this dress is worth the price, it is not even silk and the underlay feels like cheap gauze. i have been in the fashion industry for over 30 years and this is a miss mark in my opinion. put it back on the rack, and save your $ for something better at sweet retailer!",General,Dresses,Dresses,48

_____________

it is tts and hangs nicely on the body, even for gals with longer backs. there was no issue of see-through with the blue (hopefully the pink is the same) due to the dark color and thicker material. the sides are a tad see-through, but only at the cap sleeves! the rest is well lined.

9377,Great for the short waisted,"I loved this top. loved it. the quality and color ( i got the red) are wonderful. the top fit perfectly through the chest and the a-line design was super flattering through the waist. however, i am long waisted and the top was simply too short on me. even when worn with mid-rise trousers, my belly showed when i leaned to the side or reached my arms above my shoulders. i so hoped it would be perfect with skinny jeans or leggings - as shown on the model - but on a long-waisted frame it is simply t",General,Tops,Knits,44

21304,This was used!!!,"Got this in the blue and was so excited. while it looks cute, someone had clearly bought this, worn it, and returned it. it had human and dog hair all over it. not to mention some kind of red strings. it was pilling all over. so much for quality control!!! i don't mind buying used things but at least clean it up and give me a discount!",General,Dresses,Dresses,35
15537,Essential feminine white blouse,"I love a crisp white poplin blouse and this top is perfect in that role. i am between a small and medium in retailer tops. because this top looked a little bell in the model photos, i decided to order a 6. it was a bit snug across the chest. for reference, i am a 34c. i returned it for the 8 and it fit perfect. i'm not sure why this top was offered during the winter because it will likely hang in my closet until april. highly recommend this blouse for summer.",General,Tops,Blouses,72
16872,Great top for pregnant women:),I recently bought this top in both the black and blue motifs and love it! i'm currently 7 months pregnant and this top provides great coverage for the bump. i agree with another reviewer that noted that it is a little tight in the bust as i had to go up a size for that reason.,General,Tops,Blouses,30
9930,Stunning coat,"I received this coat today and i'm ecstatic about my purchase. i am a true petite, and the petite large in this coat fit perfectly. i was a little worried about the sizing based on the other reviews. yes, the button is low, but that is the style. i strongly suggest ordering a petite if you are short. otherwise, the fit may be completely off.",General,Jackets,Outerwear,62

3628,Wanted to love...,"I have been looking for a nice, white tunic and i should have known when i saw this was one size fits all. maybe because i am petite (5'2"") but there was so much material hanging everywhere that it made me look even shorter and fat. who wants that? so sending it back.",General,Tops,Blouses,46

5023,Beautiful but boxy,"Such a beautiful and unique design - i only wish it fit! it is so, so boxy - i'm thin, but would have needed almost a foot of fabric removed in order to make it look right (and i don't mean making it super tight). the seaming and button details on the back are such that it would be tough to have a tailor refit it appropriately. so, i had to return this, despite really wanting to find a way to make it work.",General,Tops,Knits,31
20679,Great shirt but runs large,This is a nice shirt and very flattering. the ivory is actually more of a tan/brown- i would not call it ivory or off white. the material has a nice texture to it as well. it does run big and long so keep that in mind when purchasing.,General Petite,Tops,Knits,40
12052,Super soft and relaxed,"Got this in the ""dark blue"" wash; there is significantly less color variation than pictured online; it's a medium wash, and incredibly soft. i typically wear m or l in this brand due to very broad shoulders and muscular biceps: if you have a similar frame and you typically wear one of two sizes, go with your larger size.

2792,Casual layering piece,"This is great, lightweight top layer that's just right for the little evening chill in the summer when the sun goes down, or on a breezy day. it's sheer, so it requires a bottom layer. the medium fits a little tighter across the shoulders and arms for me than it shows on the model, which i like.",Initmates,Intimate,Layering,50

1714,Cute shirt,"The material is more like a great tee for the sleeves and the back, so it is so comfortable. i agree with the previous review, i am not thrilled about the hook and eye, but it still looks cute with a tank under it. i bought it in black and i am ordering it as well in white. it looks great with skinny jeans or pants.",General,Tops,Knits,59
17755,Flattering and feminine,"I was on the fence about another patchwork design peasant inspired blouse, but once i tried this on i fell in love. it drapes beautifullly, is not too short, and just feels pretty. for reference i am 5 feet 6 inches, 140 lbs. 36b and usually wear a medium in tops. the medium fits and flows perfectly, hiding all my mature woman problem areas.
i purchased quite a few items on the 40% off sale, and this is one of my top favorites. i love the versatility, just gorgeous for casual wear or dressy.",General,Tops,Blouses,61

22694,"Unless you are twiggy, this is shape less","This dress hangs horribly. unlike the photo, the waist does not cinch. too bad. the colors are great and the quality of the material is nice. because i bought it on sale, i may try to tailor it to work, but unless you are willing to do that, its a no go. :-(",General Petite,Dresses,Dresses,45
12136,Very nice!,"This top works very well with a white or green cardigan for work. the color is more green than in the photo and it is wider on the bottom. it hides a non-flat stomach very well without looking matronly. i ordered a small petite, but i am heavy on top so i did not find the armhole problem that the other reviewer had. my only con is that i don't love the high-low thing that every retailer top seems to have these days, but i can live with it.",General,Tops,Blouses,49

12378,"Versatile, great spring & winter color","Color of the dress matches color on my monitor. the neckline is sheer. i am 5'4"" ,125 lbs, 32d and ordered a size 6. i thought it fit perfect. this is a great spring/summer dress and can be worn with dress heels or flats for a dressier look. it can also be worm with tennis shoes (white converse are my choice) for a more casual look.

i think this dress could also transition to a fall/winter piece paired with tights and a suit jacket or cardigan. 

also, i love the pockets, though i do see ho",General,Dresses,Dresses,32

19806,Trusted my instincts,"My wardrobe craves lush detail-rich dresses like this beautiful maxi.  knowing that the dress is expensive and made of all synthetic fabric, i took the plunge and purchased the largest of my size range.  i've noticed that most indian labels commissioned by retailer fit tighter in my chest/shoulders, so i'm glad i trusted my instincts and bought the 12p as it fits perfectly on my 36dd chest and wide shoulders.  this is not a casual dress--there are sequins, beads and rosettes decorating the bodice.",General,Dresses,Dresses,39
5503,Perfect dress,This is a great maxi dress for people that want a classic fit but nothing tight. it is figure flattering yet modest enough to wear to work. i am 5'3 (and a half!) and many maxis are so long that i must wear heels. this one is perfect length for me and can be worn with flats or heels.,General Petite,Dresses,Dresses,47

9940,Comfortable and relaxed look,"The quality and design of this top is great and it goes well with my skinny jeans and wide-leg linen trousers. only thing is that it does need to air dry or i imagine it will shrink up which would not be good for taller frames. i'm slim, 5'8"" and got an xs and it fits just right. the carbon color appears to have hints of blue/purple on screen, but it's actually a plain dark gray.",General,Tops,Knits,43

20553,Cute and comfy,"I love this shirt. i ordered a large because i am taller, and i wanted the length to be right. while it's a little baggy, it's still very flattering and i've received lots of compliments on it. the color is exactly what is show in the image. it's a versatile shirt; depending on what you pair it with it can be appropriate for work, dinner, or a night out. i'd definitely recommend this shirt to a friend.",General Petite,Tops,Knits,25

2200,Adorable but not really a cardigan more a capelet,"I gave this 4 stars instead of five because the picture really does give you the impression that this ""cardigan"" has sleeves but actually it's a cape with a few stitches above the wrist. it's also quite short, i'm only 5 5"" and it hits me above my waist. this picture was clearly shot with the front pulled down, i bet if we saw the back it would be high above her waist. also, one of the buttons fell off the first time i wore it. i heard it fall thankfully so it was easy enough to sew back on but",General,Tops,Sweaters,50
