3069,,"I purchased this sweater in the grey and loved it.
much prettier in person, the photos do not show the delicate details, which are lovely.
i found that it fits true to size and has a very flattering fit.
it is also a very versatile piece depending on what you pair it with.
i love it so much that i purchased the peach and wine colors as well.
i found all 3 colors beautiful and each gives this sweater a different look.
the grey is sophisticated and works well with almost anything.
the peach is del",General,Tops,Fine gauge,83

6713,Love!!,"I feel for the reviewer who didn't like this top. i tried on my normal size medium and it was not very flattering (just too short). when i sized up, everything changed. this top is amazing--super flattering and high quality. i love the material, v-cut, and subtle way the tassels hang. i wish they had more colors-i would buy them all! this top sold out in a day at my store. it's a winner-just make sure you size up.",General,Tops,Knits,67

12124,Lovely fall coat,"I just received this coat and love it. the only downside is that online the color looks like a royal blue (which i wanted) but in truth the coat is a basic navy. this was not a deal breaker for me. i love the details. it is not lined as someone mentioned earlier but it's not meant to be a heavy winter coat. i can't wait to wear it with jeans, boots and a striped or plaid tunic.",General,Jackets,Outerwear,36

195,Lovely and feminine,"Finally a ""swing top"" that doesn't look like a sack on me! i've been wanting to partake of this current style, but everything i've tried so far just looks ""dumpy"" on me. not this top -- it is very feminine and flattering. i am 5'7"" 118 lbs and have a small waist -- and although this is a ""swing"" style, it still shows my waist and doesn't overpower me. it is also a lovely fabric -- especially in the soft pink which i got. i'm thinking of going back for more colors!",General Petite,Tops,Fine gauge,62

17944,Beautiful dress!,"My mother, who is not a dress person, ordered this dress for a summer wedding in the black hills. we'd spend 20+ hours searching for the perfect dress, and she'd returned three other options (different stores). after admiring this dress for awhile, she decided to try it, and is so happy she did! the color is just a slightly darker shade of purple than what is pictured in most of the images, but that's what she was hoping for. it fits wonderfully, and looks extremely elegant.",General Petite,Dresses,Dresses,20

16538,Voluminous eye catching dress,"Mes demosilles style incorporates lots of material. this cotton layered, voluminous dress is an eye catcher but not for all figures. i like this bohemian style because it is different and can be worn with a belt to show off more of your figure or loose fitting. 
i ordered a 36 size which fitted perfectly around the bust but i have broad shoulders and there is no zipper. i had to purchase the 38 size so i could remove the dress over my shoulders without too much trouble.",General Petite,Dresses,Dresses,68

13158,Sunny surprise,"Perhaps it is the 69's vibe that hit me, but i had to check this out with the free shipping week. i am so glad that i did!
i fear wool as i have sensitive skin but this is soft and snuggly. the structure will allow for fit over many different types of under-layers, but unlike so much offered lately, it is not huge or tent-like, but a perfect fit. it is a heavier weight - light coat weight? this is perfect for me in the south. the color is as pictured, golden. in my xxs petite, the sleeves are p",General,Tops,Sweaters,64
2017,"Beautiful, soft and cozy","As one would expect from boucle, this sweater is incredibly soft, warm and cozy without being heavy. i fell in love with it when i first saw it and got it in white color. it's beautiful, goes with casual and work clothing (belt helps with the latter styling), and it didn't leave lint on the dark skirt i wore with it to work! i usually wear xs or s and found this sweater to be still roomy in xs, with sleeves being a bit long. i hope it won't stretch with wear as boucles sometimes do - that's my o",General Petite,Tops,Sweaters,41

the fabric is 100% rayon and has a beautiful drape, so it doesn't poof out like a maternity dress. it is lined, has 3/4 sleeves with an elasticized cuff, and hits around my knee. this dress could have definitely supported pockets in the side seams or patch pockets on the front. i have",General,Dresses,Dresses,56

i ordered the yellow one, and was surprised how yellow it was when received. it is brighter than the picture shows, not bad though.
the cut of the dress is nice, very ""sweet"", i liked that it was flowy and the lace was beautiful to me. arms were a tad tight, only because i have muscular arms. stil lable to wear it.

i would recommend this top. very flattering and dressy if you want it to be.",General Petite,Tops,Fine gauge,45
9363,A perfect skirt,"Similar to the previous reviewer, i'm also between sizes and for pencil skirts it's usually the larger size that end up fitting. whether this skirt runs large or maybe because it has a slight stretch, my smaller size (10) fits perfectly and seems comfortable enough to wear on a long flight or road trip. the fabric is wonderful, the skirt length is great for work, and the styling is really nice with added detail of buttoned loops at the waist. if i had one negative comment it would be an itty bit",General,Bottoms,Skirts,64

2736,On trend,"Cute off-the-shoulder top with a dark floral motif totally on trend for fall. as previous reviews mentioned, material is ribbed, which makes it look a bit like corduroy. but, it is not thick so it just makes it seem more appropriate for colder weather. i think it will be great with skinny jeans and a choker.",General,Tops,Knits,41

11390,Gorgeous - great piece for work,"Love love love. i tried it on a whim when returning a shipped item. it's gorgeous and incredibly flattering. runs large (it's drapey and would likely look good in your normal size since you can synch the waist, but probably best to size down as it seemed large in the bust size - which isn't an issue i usually run into).

this shirt dind't seem like it had too much fabric or too bulky to me as it did to others adn i tried on a larger size. teh material is soft and feminine, and love the embroidered detail. one thing to note is i found that even with the layer of fabric, it was still a bit sheer and i could see through in some of the dressing room lighting. didn't purchase only based on the skin tone v's shirt color. color of shirt is gorgeous, but i am pale and it wasn't",General Petite,Tops,Blouses,39

4044,Product has holes in the pocket area,This is a very soft and comfortable jacket but it has holes in the pocket area. it was returned to the store and the other jackets had the same problem although not in the same area. the store was considering pulling the product off their shelves. it is unclear if the holes are just the beginning of a pocket or what. but it was flawed by everyone who looked at it.,Initmates,Intimate,Lounge,66

13254,Dissappointed,"Was very surprised when i opened the package, this dress is very thin fabric and you need to wear a half slip as it is see through. the top of the dress is short to the draw string and does not drape bloused style at all. i have a short waist length so it should have worked. the color is a little darker than pictured, but over all looks cheap so full price with tax makes it way over priced. going back asap.",General,Dresses,Dresses,74

12589,Love!,I love this! i agree with previous post that say  it is much better in person. the fabric is high quality but not too thick. i bought this to have something light to wear on a trip to italy and it will be perfect. the color is so lovely and the flowy detail at the hem makes it unique. it's a basic without being basic. i'm so glad i added it to my wardrobe.,General Petite,Tops,Knits,29

5336,"Weird fit, makes you look like you're on stilts","I was so excited about these pants but they were a total disappointment in person. the fabric is a rough gauzy texture. the bottom has a big hem that weighs down the pants and makes them hang funny like you are walking on stilts or something, they do not hang or move well on the body. also, they are very long but small in the waist and have a high crotch so the fit is pretty off. sadly, these are going back.",General,Bottoms,Pants,36

29,Great layering piece,"This sweater is so comfy and classic - it balances a quirky hand-knit look with a beautiful color and practical fit. it is a bit cropped and boxy as part of the style, and as others mentioned, there are gaps in the knit that make it see-through. in my opinion this makes it perfect for layering! i like having a longer camisole showing underneath, or wearing it over a little dress. it's warm but still thin enough to fit under a jacket or coat.",General,Tops,Sweaters,28
22947,Wide and muted color,This looked really pretty but i think i am just too short for it. a little on the wider side. would look good on someone taller,General,Tops,Blouses,29

14965,Chic minimalism,"Love the simple non-fussy style of this dress. note that the color is not ivory, as described and expected (not the first time retailer makes that mistake), however i still found the oatmealish-warm beige color to be flattering to my skin tone (warm tones look best on me). like that the shoulders are covered while still feeling sleeveless, gives it a dressier feel. the fine texture is lovely. this does drape up top, while the bottom clings a bit, but not overly much for me to feel immodest. i am 5",General Petite,Dresses,Dresses,40
14838,Almost a winner for me -- almost,"I saw this on a mannequin at the store and was instantly drawn in by all the beautiful blue lace and the overall design. however, when i tried it on, i personally found a few things that just didn't work for me:
____________
pros:
- blue lace is lovely throughout, nicely done.
- there's a little snap closure at the front of the dress where the fabric overlaps at the bra cups. i can only assume it's to make it easier to get the dress on. it's a nice little detail, although not sure if really",General,Dresses,Dresses,34
3402,Not as expected,"The top was very small. i am usually a size small but this was tight around the top, arm holes and it was short. also i didn't notice if it said it was sheer ( see through) in the description but it definitely requires another shirt underneath.",General,Tops,Knits,48
10110,Comfortable long-sleeved tee,"Very pretty top. runs a bit large (i generally take an xs and the xs in this top fits me a little longer and larger than on the model). comfortable and easy to wear. nice cut with angled front and bit longer back. did develop a small hole very quickly as some thinner and tissue tees do but hoping that's unusual as i did buy two different colors of this tee shirt and will be totally disappointed if this happens to both, especially at this price.",General,Tops,Knits,29
16328,Great dress!,"This is one of the best things i've ever purchased at retailer. it's comfortable, stylish, and flattering. i ordered it in black, and i'm now ordering the green as well. i usually wear small in the dolan line, and this is no exception. i am 5'2"", 135 lbs, athletic build, and the regular small fits perfectly.",General Petite,Dresses,Dresses,32
20988,Soft and comfortable,"Cute dress. i say true to size - but keep in mind it is loose and flowy and i purchased in my usual size medium and it fits perfectly. it's lined so there is no need for a slip. very comfortable and cool. i am 5'6"" and it is 3"" above knee. i paired it with the gemline lariat turquoise necklace and have already received several compliments and my day is only 1/2 over!
a great priced dress which holds true to retailer's quality and uniqueness of items offered.",General,Dresses,Dresses,51
12624,Cute and trendy,"These jeans really look very nice on. they are 99% cotton and 1% elastaine. if you want the look that you see on this model, order one size up. i am 5'9""/136 lbs. bought both 27 and 28. decided to keep the 28. mainly because the lower part of the leg was fitting too tight in the 27, looked more like a skinny jean but bunched up at the knee -- they are tapered. (i also own a pair of 100% cotton levi's wedgie in foot hills in size 27 which fit a bit different than these -- the foot hills definitel",General,Bottoms,Jeans,54
21408,Great fit for size 12,I love pilco jeans - they fit in all the right ways for a size 12. this is a great pair of everyday casual jeans. a tiny bit oversized in the ankle (a bit of a flair) but overall i am very happy! very comfortable.,General Petite,Bottoms,Jeans,26
22905,,Love love love!!! it is a little boxy but it is soo soft and comfortable!! it does run at least a size or 2 big!! i picked it up in the pink color yesterday at me local retailer store. was not sure about it when i first saw it online but fell in love with it quickly when i tried it on!!  great sweater for fall/winter,General,Tops,Sweaters,46
9731,Love these pants until i washed them,"I bought these in the mustard color and the salmon color.  i didn't have a problem with general fading, but used natural, mild stain remover (biokleen) and the pants were ruined. one faded where i sprayed and the other has a permanent water mark.  cold wash and line dried. such a bummer that these pants aren't every day wearable and washable!",General,Bottoms,Pants,44
21831,Very cute,I really like how this fits. it is soft and the eyelet details are very cute.,General Petite,Tops,Knits,39
1274,Beautiful,"The rose color is lighter than the photo of the model in front of the pink building, but on the other photos it does look lighter so i wasn't surprised.  my dress fits very nicely. i love the drop waist, the loose fit at the hips, and the flare of the ruffles.  the back is just like the model too. i thought it may be boxy but it comes in at the waist and goes a-line. perfect. i ordered the xl because it wanted it to be loose like on the model.  i was afraid because of my large dd chest it would",General,Dresses,Dresses,45
18776,Yes yes yes,"I promised myself only one pair of joggers this year, and these were the ones i went with (in the blue motif). for me the tipping point was the quality and fit of these were far superior than the others i tried, while still being machine washable. the fabric has aa little substance, yet is still lightweight and comfortable. the fit has a perfect bit of tailoring/tapering to be ultra-flattering while having the comfort of pajama pants. the blue motif is adorable too - love the geometric shapes. l",General,Bottoms,Pants,62
623,,Love love love these leggings and what an amazing price point!!!,Initmates,Intimate,Legwear,57
4316,Extremely awkward,"I bought this online so didn't realize that the fabric at the bottom is very, very stiff. i was expecting something silky, or at least on the softer and more moveable side. the best description i can think of is an overly starched mens dress shirt. that being the case, it kind of juts out in weird places. the sweater part is very nice, but it is somewhat closer fitting than what it seems in the picture. the fabric bottom is too ample for the slimmer design of the sweater which just adds to the o",General,Dresses,Dresses,46
6637,Sweet sweater,"I like this sweater very much. it's short but not too short, and soft but not fluffy. the design is a little interesting rather than plain and the colors (i ordered the tan) are great for me, a redhead. i'm 5'3"", 125 lbs and don't like clingy tops so i took a m and it's perfect. really cutewith jeans.",General,Tops,Fine gauge,61
11366,Oversized tshirt,"I really wanted to like this... it's soft and cozy and a nice shade of blue, but that's where the positives end. i ordered the xs and it was huge. wide, shapeless, and way too long (i'm 105lbs and 5'1). even if it came in petite, i'm not sure it's worth the price, because i can imagine the thin material losing its shape and getting stretched out.",General,Dresses,Dresses,46
2964,,This is a really pretty top that you can dress up or down. the draping on the neck and shoulders falls nicely and i love the back with the lace. it is simple but unique and has nice classic lines. i am usually a pxs but based on the measurements i went with the regular xxs and glad i did bc the petite would have been too short.,General Petite,Tops,Knits,40
12793,Love,"...a little long still, but loved the fit.
flattering on me, i have thighs and these balanced out the thigh effect. color (wash) was also very nice in my opinion. can be wrn with any top, really, i had to make myself return them jsut coz of price, but on my wish list for sure!",General,Bottoms,Jeans,39
12677,Lovely cozy and stylish sweater,"It's a cozy sweater that doesn't make me feel frumpy, still stylish and it's not too heavy but still warm enough. it's like wearing a blanket sort of. definitely sheer with the big loom, wear a camisole under it. i got compliments the first day i wore it!",General,Tops,Sweaters,34

20650,Checkerboard sleep top,I only say that this sleep top runs small because it shrinks a whole size after you wash it. i'd recommend that you order up a size for that reason. otherwise it is cute. i am ordering the shorts to go with it.,Initmates,Intimate,Sleep,63
10126,Horrible,"This looks nothing like it does on the website. it runs small and the colors are so muddy. it doesn't drape nicely and i a musually an xs and this was short, stiff and plain ugly. sent it back immediately.",General Petite,Tops,Blouses,33
22961,Comfortable knit dress,"I'm a 12/14 and i got a large and the dress fits nicely through the hips/seat. i'm kind of pear shaped so it's a bit large through the top, but i intend to layer another knit top under it so that's ok. 
 i didn't want the knit dress to be too tight or else it would stretch out after sitting. i like the colors and the fabric. the weave is loose and after snagging it on my glasses taking it off i'm careful with it. it will be nice into fall with a sweater.",General Petite,Dresses,Dresses,58
5717,The perfect tee for atlanta's hot weather!,I agree with the other reviewers about sizing down in this tee. the colors are beautiful and design lovely. i love how the sleeves are finished and the neckline. i purchased at my local retailer store along with the flower days tee (that i purchased in a larger size because of the differences in the design of the two shirts). highly recommend both!,General,Tops,Knits,62
